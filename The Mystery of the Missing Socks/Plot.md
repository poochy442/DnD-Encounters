# The Mystery of the Missing Socks

In the city of Nomont, a mysterious creature has been plagueing the citizens by stealing their socks. It comes under the cover of night and is rarely seen. A few witnesses say they saw a small, winged creature scurry out of their homes when they awoke to a sound in their house.

## Beginning

The story begins with the party returning from an adventure in the evening. As they show their IDs at the gate, they are informed of the situation, and asked if they can help on patrol, as they are short on hands (which also means they can offer a greater than usual reward)

- Party chooses to patrol

The party is given a section of the town and is asked to patrol it. About an hour in, they hear shouting in their area, and rush to investigate. As they get there, they see the winged creature running from a man, running in the street without socks or shoes on. The creature quickly scurries through a drain-pipe into the sewers. If the party chooses to talk to the man, he will confirm that the creature did indeed steal his socks and that is their target.

The part will now have to find a way into the sewers to find and slay the creature.

- Party choses not to patrol

As the party comes back to their house and go to sleep, have them roll a perception check. If any succeeds, tell them they awake to an unusual sound. As they go to check it out, they see all their socks in the hands of a small winged creature, just going out of the door. if they chase, they see the creature scurry into the sewer from the door.

## Getting to the sewers

There is a maintenance tunnel into the sewers, protected by the guards of the town, however as they are adventurers, they simply need a written request from the Guild. With that, they can enter the sewer (legally) to find and slay the creature.

## Encounters

In the sewers, they will find a group of rats.
Depending on how they approach them, they may get them in smaller groups, but there are a total of:

- 21 [Rats](./Monsters/Rat.pdf)
- 7 [Giant Rats](./Monsters/Giant%20Rat.pdf)

Further down in a lair of its own, they will find the winged creature: a [Nabassu](./Monsters/Nabassu.pdf)

## Extra notes

The Nabassu is a demon, though it is an outcast, because it consumes souls.

This specific Nabassu was too naive though, as it fell for a prank from a fellow demon, that told it that it should actually be collecting **socks**.

This is why it went through a portal to the material plane and followed it's instincts by terrorizing the town - it just did it slightly incorrectly.

(this is why it is child-friendly, the REAL encounter had people with sucked souls)
